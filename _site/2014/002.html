<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">With the
emerging technology of multimedia devices, we are surrounded with digital media
– TV/radio shows, movies/videos, and music are examples of common multimedia
formats that we encounter on a daily basis. Multimedia data are usually created
with specialised authoring tools regardless of whether they are large-scale
Hollywood films or home videos of a trip to the Grand Canyon. While many of
these authoring tools traditionally offer advanced features required by
experts, in recent years, we started to see more introductory tools targeting
less advanced users. These applications offer simplified ways to author
multimedia content; for example, wizard- or template-based authoring tools,
often seen in mobile applications, allow users to bypass complex steps using
predefined parameters and workspace templates while others simply omit or hide
advanced features that are too difficult for novices to use and learn. These
tools usually look simpler but often do not allow users to create and modify
fine details of the media. Our approach presented in this paper also attempts
to support novice users of multimedia authoring tools. It differs from the
aforementioned approaches, however, in that we consider multimedia authoring
tasks as a type of problem-solving and task-planning processes, and attempt to
support users by incorporating an approach that is grounded on the cognitive
models originally developed in the context of task-planning and
problem-solving. We will illustrate how the proposed approach might translate
to practical examples and suggest possible support features for existing
authoring tools.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 1. 1. Motivation </p>

<p class="body">Not only
does multimedia authoring require knowledge and skills of creative tasks, but
it is also inevitable for users to possess thorough knowledge of digital data
manipulation. Studies [1, 2, 3, 4] show that designing creativity support tools
is still difficult. Based on the related literature [5, 6, 7] and our own
general observation of users performing multimedia authoring tasks, novices and
experts exhibit behaviours that can be summarized with respect to Norman's
classic "Seven stages of actions" [8]. Common problems novices encounter when
performing multimedia authoring tasks are well described by referring these
stages, and experts tend to display superior performance at each stage.
Consequently, when using the same tools, experts can effectively minimize the
gulfs of both execution and evaluation due to their familiarity with the tasks
and the tools. Furthermore, the ability to come up with proper goals and to
find ways to reach the goals are essential for generating mental representation
of a task, and generating a proper mental task model is one of the critical
processes for successful task performance [7]. Supporting users generate and
maintain proper representation of a task can be therefore beneficial especially
when they have little experience with multimedia authoring tasks.</p>

<h4> 2. Preliminary Studies </h4>

<p class="subhead"> 2. 1. User Observation,
Interviews, and Surveys </p>

<p class="body">From the early general
observation of users, multimedia authoring tasks seem to share certain characteristics
of problem-solving and task-planning, and therefore users may benefit from
tools that support them perform complex multimedia authoring tasks in such a
way to accommodate strategies used in problem-solving. To further reinforce
this premise, we have conducted additional user observation, interviews and
online surveys with professionals and amateurs (both advanced and novice
users). The purpose of these preliminary studies was twofold: 1) to understand
the ways advanced and novice users prepare for and perform multimedia authoring
tasks and how they differ, and 2) to see how task-planning and problem-solving strategies
might help these users in the context of multimedia authoring tasks. The
settings of each of the preliminary studies are as follows: for user
observation, we had two novice users with a little experience in home video
editing but less than 1 year, performing video editing using Adobe Premiere and
Windows Movie Maker respectively, and one advanced video editor working on a
short-film using Apple Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere were observed; we
interviewed five professional and two amateur video editors/sound engineers
were contacted for interviews with regards to their typical workflow, their
opinions/concerns about existing tools; eight novice users responded to online
surveys on multimedia authoring tasks and issues with tasks and existing tools.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 2. 2. Key Findings from
the Preliminary Studies </p>

<p class="body">The
findings from these preliminary studies suggest that the multimedia authoring
processes do in fact share some of the characteristics of task-planning and
problem-solving processes, and thus they seem to support our initial premise.
They also suggest possible designs and features of multimedia authoring support
tools, which we will discuss in details in Section 4.</p>

<p class="body">One
salient finding was that concrete workflow was typically formed by experts
while novices had problems with coming up with one. This was observed in all
the stages of the studies, but particularly in the user observation, novices
started tasks in a more exploratory manner, but advanced users were able to
plan ahead what needed to be done. Another key finding was that novices did not
seem able to easily find a set of actions to escape from unwanted situations.
For instance, when a desired action was unavailable, novices often could not
know what actions were needed to be performed to make those desired action
performable. And for another example, one of the respondents of the survey
noted that "the biggest obstacle was that it was hard to think creatively
because I was just unaware of the options." These examples illustrate that even
when novice users know what they want to accomplish, they may still have
problems with actually figuring out <i>how</i> to accomplish it.</p>

<p class="body">Many
novice users also expressed that they would like to be able to see the overview
of the task that they were working on. This is understandable as existing tools
usually only provide undo lists that do not provide much useful information on
task context. While advanced users may be able to mentally maintain task
context, it can be difficult for those who lack experience in multimedia
authoring tasks.</p>

<h4>3. Related Work </h4>

<p class="body">Although,
to our knowledge, there is no previous research conducted to develop a
multimedia authoring support tool that attempts to enable application of
problem-solving strategies, several approaches to support novice users during
multimedia authoring tasks have been investigated. One obvious approach is to
reduce the complexity of the interface design used in existing tools. This
approach is often seen in commercial products such as [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], and
in research projects such as [14], which reduce the complexity of its interface
based on the context of the task. Another approach seen in quite a few
commercially available products, especially in mobile apps, is to use the
template- and wizard-based approach. The examples include [15, 16, 17]. These
tools first ask the user to import/select media files that they would like to
use such as videos, still images, and music/sound track(s). The users will be
then asked to select a theme or style of the final product, and then the tools
will automatically create appropriate media based on the predefined parameters.
Another group of tools [18, 19, 20] use an approach to replace existing
interface paradigms and provide users with unique interface designs.</p>

<p class="body">Our design
approach presented in this paper clearly differs from these tools in that it
complements authoring tasks by supporting some strategies used in
problem-solving and providing the contextual information of the task.</p>

<p class="body">Furthermore,
while not within creative domains and their main focuses are not to support
novice users, there are studies that attempt to model tasks and task
structures, and to visualize those using unique notation and visualization
methods [21, 22, 23, 24]. </p>

<h4>4. Multimedia Authoring
and Problem-Solving </h4>

<p class="body">In this
section, we will elaborate the above premise by first analysing general
multimedia authoring tasks and tools, and then presenting the relevant theories
of problem-solving and task-planning primarily developed in the fields of
Cognitive Psychology and Artificial Intelligence.</p>


<p class="subhead">4. 1. Multimedia
Authoring Tasks and Authoring Tools </p>


<p class="body">The
current style of multimedia authoring and editing has emerged from the early
days of film and sound production devices, and techniques developed with those
devices [25]. The interface of software tools have been designed so that the
authoring styles and techniques used with the hardware counterparts can be
closely emulated in digital environment and thus, the appearance of typical
tools is extremely similar to the look-and-feel of the corresponding hardware
devices. Figure 1 shows screenshots of common multimedia authoring tools.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>
Figure 1. Screenshots of popular authoring tools Apple GarageBand (left) and Adobe Premiere (right).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">While in a
broad sense, multimedia authoring tasks can refer to creation and editing of
digital media in many different formats, we focus on two of the quintessential
tasks; video editing and music/sound production. Through these tasks, we author
the majority of multimedia content we encounter in daily life. These tasks
share some key elements such as creation of media that have a temporal element
so that they can be played back, dealing with one or more data streams that can
be simultaneously played back, and structuring one or more data clips for
appropriate data streams (called tracks) along the time axis to specify the
timing of the clips to be played.</p>

<p class="body">Multimedia
authoring requires knowledge and skills derived from both creative tasks and
digital data manipulation. In multimedia authoring, proficiency in generating
creative ideas and working towards ideal goals becomes practical only when
complemented by the familiarity with the tools that translate the creative
ideas into digital media. It is not uncommon therefore to see artists and
creators often struggle when transitioning to software tools. Furthermore,
while people with experience in general creative tasks may find at least some
critical skills transferable to the digital authoring, novices seem to find it
challenging to progress to reach a certain level of proficiency.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 4. 2. Creative Tasks and
Problem-Solving Strategies</p>


<p class="body">Creative
tasks typically involve processes that are the key aspects of the
problem-solving, such as identifying goals, assessing the current situation,
recognising available actions, and pursuing the chosen actions (or modify them
accordingly) towards the desired goals. When attempting to solve complex
problems such as creative tasks, humans often use heuristics and strategies to
either reduce the complexity of the problem and/or systematically undertake
only smaller parts of the problem. The following are cognitive models of these
strategies.</p>

<p class="body">The
top-down approach [26, 27, 28, 29] is often referred to as problem-reduction or
task-reduction, and its basic idea is to first break down the original problem
into smaller subproblems and then recursively apply the reduction until each
sub-problem becomes trivial enough to be solved directly without further
reductions. The bottom-up strategy [6, 28, 29, 30, 31] is triggered by
lower-level, detailed information, and is often regarded as a data-driven
approach. In this strategy, the task performer starts with focused lower-level
actions/subtasks that directly operate on/for given data, and then the future
actions will be planned and performed by gradually working towards more
abstract and contextual solutions of the task. The opportunistic strategy [32,
33, 34] is modelled after a much more unstructured way that humans generally
perform task-planning and problem-solving. The idea behind this cognitive model
is that humans often make problem-solving decisions spontaneously rather than
strictly in the previously planned manner, thus both the top-down and bottom-up
strategies are employed throughout the task. The task performer more freely
shifts the focus of the abstraction and hierarchical levels of the task-space.</p>


<h4> 5. Towards Designing
Multimedia Authoring Task Support Tools </h4>

<p class="body">To
facilitate the designing process of support tools for multimedia authoring
tasks, we will now discuss how the theories of task-planning and
problem-solving may be applied to multimedia authoring tasks.</p>


<p class="subhead"> 5. 1. Problem Solving
Strategies and Multimedia Authoring </p>

<p class="body">In the
previous section, three major strategies have been identified, and we will discuss
here some of the most common cases in which these strategies are invoked in
multimedia authoring tasks. The top-down strategy is used when attempting to
solve complex problems by first setting the overall goal, and then dividing it
into smaller, more manageable sub-goals. In multimedia authoring tasks, a user
may start the task by sketching out a very rough idea of the kinds of media
that she is creating; e.g., 30-second TV commercial. She may then determine
what media materials are needed, given the basic ideas of what the medium is
supposed to deliver to the audience. From there, she can look for particular
media, think about how these media should be edited, and so on, thus working
towards more detailed parts of the task. On the other hand, the bottom-up
strategy is motivated by (new) incoming data at a detailed level that triggers
some changes in the higher level in the hierarchy. For example, suppose the
video editor finds a new media clip that is more suitable for the current
project. She might then tentatively replace the old clip with this new one,
which consequently forces a sequence of operations in order to accommodate this
new clip into the current workspace such as adjusting the lengths and changing
several parameters of both this new and the other existing clips. That is, a
sequence of actions are triggered by this new data clip and thus it forces the
user to "go up" the hierarchy levels to examine more contextual information of
the task in order to perform other necessary actions. The opportunistic
strategy can be considered as a combination of both the top-down and the bottom-up
strategies and it provides more flexibility in terms of the ways users perceive
and perform tasks. To some extent, with existing tools, users perform the
opportunistic strategy as these tools are designed to accommodate the most
flexible styles of authoring processes typically required by advanced users.</p>

<p class="body">One of the
issues of the standard authoring tools is that they usually lack explicit
support for viewing the task structures. While it may not be a big problem for
experienced users, it is generally difficult for novices to correctly generate
and maintain the mental representation of the task, especially when the task
progresses and the performed actions and their hierarchical and sequential
relationships become too complex to be handled by humans. This could cause
problems even for advanced users when they need to revisit their past actions
to modify what they have done, or more commonly, when they resume their task
after a long period of inactivity from the task. Task interruptions occur
frequently during a multimedia production that sometimes lasts for months.
Another advantage that existing tools may gain from explicit support for
viewing the task structures is that it clarifies the context of the task and it
will therefore likely help novice users to be more aware of what their short-
and long-term goals are. We will elaborate these issues in the following
section.</p>


<p class="subhead"> 5.2. Implication of
Interface Designs </p>

<p class="body"> As
existing tools do not usually provide explicit support for viewing structured
tasks and actions, the available resource closest to this kind of support is
the undo list, which is a linear sequence of performed actions, and, to some
extent, the menu structures which group items based on the types of actions.
For example, the menu entry <i>Fil</i>e may have such items as <i>Open</i>, <i>New</i>,
and <i>Save</i>, all of which are actions that involve file operations. While
this is one way to create a hierarchical structure of the task, this organisation
is seriously limited when it comes to reviewing tasks. Consider the following
case in which we are trying to organise the undo list of actions by grouping
them using the parent menu labels of these actions. Figure 2.a. shows a partial
list of actions performed during a video production task by the authors. One
way we could build a hierarchical structure of this task-space is to group
actions under menu labels whenever one or more consecutive actions are from the
same menu label. This is shown in Figure 2.b.</p>


<figure>
<img src="002-JMTA_files/image002.png" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 2. (a)Action list (left) and (b) Action list with Menu Labels (right).</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">However,
neither this list of the menu labels (the left column of Figure 2.b.) nor the
original list of low-level actions (Figure 2.a.) tells us exactly what kinds of
sub-tasks were performed. Furthermore, as the task progresses further, this
list of the menu labels only gets longer and it will become even harder to
decipher what types of sub-tasks were performed at different stages of the
task. Therefore, we need a slightly different approach for grouping and organising
actions and sub-tasks for our purpose. What is missing from the above lists is
the information about the context of the task. To illustrate this, let us use
descriptions of sub-tasks to group the list of actions. The result of this new
labelling is shown in Figure 3.</p>

<figure>
<img src="002-JMTA_files/image003.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 3. Action list with Sub-task Headings.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">Using
these sub-task descriptions, the new list will look contextually much clearer (<i>Setting
up picture clip "beach.jpg" &#8594; Setting up picture clip "ocean.jpg" &#8594;
Link clips "beach.jpg" and "ocean.jpg" &#8594;  Setting up music track ("How
deep is the ocean.mp3") &#8594; Transition effects for between "beach.jpg" and
"ocean.jpg" &#8594; Saving the workspace &#8594; Creating output file "ocean-video.mp4"</i>).</p>

<p class="body">With this
slight change to the way in which the task is organised, our list of past
actions becomes much more contextually meaningful, and thus it will presumably
increase the understanding of the task structures. When users need to use a
top-down approach, the task-space representation can focus on these high-level
sub-task descriptions, and when she proceeds down the hierarchical levels to
investigate the details of the task-space, or when a bottom-up strategy should
be triggered, the tool can reveal these lower-level actions, as shown in Figure
4. A key observation here is that in addition to reviewing past actions, this
organisation can also be applied to possible future actions. For example, if a
user is performing a subtask labelled "Setting up picture clip 'beach.jpg',"
then instead of menus and toolbar icons which typically show all the available
actions, it might be more effective for the system to allow users to see and
perform only those options that are relevant to the current subtask such as
"modify the picture clip" or "apply visual effects."</p>

<h4> 6. Paper-based Mock-up
and Cognitive Walkthroughs </h4>

<p class="body">Prior to a
large-scale evaluation in user studies, some of the possible feature
implementations of our approach were evaluated using the paper-based mock-up
and by means of basic cognitive walkthroughs. The evaluators were given steps
to create a story-telling video from a set of raw media as described in Table.1.
The evaluation was based on several versions of the mock-up, differing features
such as the organisation schemes and representations of the action groups as
discussed in Section 4.  A few samples of the mock-up are shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p class="body">Although the
process was primitive, the results of this evaluation process corroborated to our
preliminary analyses and illustrated some potential issues that may be
addressed in future implementations. As expected, the additional information on
the task context, which can be provided by the structured task-space, helped
find target actions easily even when the user was not entirely familiar with
the editing tool's menus or toolbar icons. Choosing from the list of a limited
number of actions that were only relevant to the current sub-task seemed easier
than trying to find the same action from the large pool of actions such as
menus and the list of icons. One of the issues that were observed in the
preliminary studies was that novices were unable to find a proper set of
actions to escape from unwanted situations. By reducing the number of possible
actions by classifying them into contextually more meaningful groups, the
support tool can presumably decrease the chance that these users may try to
include inappropriate actions.</p>

<p class="body">The
abstracted view of the task-space seemed helpful for following the overview
steps of the task (shown in Table.1) smoothly while the grouped actions were
useful when the focus was shifted to more local-level task planning. These
results illustrate how this support tool potentially supports some
characteristics of problem-solving strategies. For example, overview of the
task corresponds to an abstract perspective typically employed at the initial
stage of the top-down strategy, while the grouped actions can provide a local
level perspective which is needed for the bottom-up strategy. By allowing the
different focus levels, the interface could be used to accommodate a more
general approach of the opportunistic strategy. In addition to the structured
task views, indicating the connection between the task-space and the data in
the workspace seemed to improve the understanding of the task being performed.</p>

<p class="body">Although
there are some limitations of this style of evaluation, they will likely lead
to design ideas for more comprehensive future studies. One such limitation is
that the comparison of the support system was against the earlier observation
of users performing arbitrary tasks. More systematic comparison of these tools
on tasks with the same complexity levels may presumably expose the effect of
this support tool. Another limitation is that this evaluation could not provide
the insight for individual effects of implemented features. In other words, we were
only able to evaluate the support tool as a whole, but were unable to isolate
effect of each feature. Testing each feature of the support tool will help us
analyze which feature will be most effective and suitable for which
situation(s) in multimedia authoring tasks.</p>

<p class="body">We have
also encountered some issues that will need to be addressed in future
implementations. Most versions of the mock-up used only two colours (black and
white), but it would likely increase the understanding of the task if some sort
of consistent colouring schemes were used for visualised objects. When using
the sub-task headings, longer headings were not very clear at a first glance,
and it could be even worse if two or more long headings share many words (e.g.,
&quot;Prepare and layout picture clip 'sakura-1.jpg' &quot; and &quot;Prepare
and layout picture clip 'sakura-2.jpg' &quot;). A better naming convention
and/or different ways to represent objects should be sought, and the consistent
colouring schemes might possibly help to solve this issue as well.</p>

<h4> 7. Conclusion </h4>

<p class="body">In this
paper, we have identified several issues when novice users try to perform
complex multimedia authoring tasks by conducting the preliminary user studies.
These studies consisted of the observation of current users performing
authoring tasks, interviews with advanced users, and the online survey with
novice users with regards to the general workflow of authoring tasks and some
difficulties that they face when attempting to learn and use these tools to
perform authoring tasks. The issues identified from these user studies were
found to be closely related to the issues when humans perform problem-solving
and task-planning activities.</p>

<p class="body">By
breaking down the characteristics of multimedia authoring tasks and comparing
with the theories of problem-solving and task-planning, we have shown that the
application of these theories for designing support tools for multimedia
authoring may open up the door to new users to learn and perform complex tasks
of multimedia authoring. The discussion of possible designs to be integrated
into existing tools is also provided.</p>

<p class="body">We have
also conducted the cognitive walkthroughs using the paper mock-up to evaluate
some features of our approach. The results of the evaluation process conformed to our preliminary
analyses and illustrated some potential issues that may be addressed in future
implementations.</p>
