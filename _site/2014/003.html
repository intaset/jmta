    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>In this work, a hybrid approach for the multimodal registration of carotid magnetic resonance and ultrasound images is described. Multimodal registration is vital for integrating or fusing complementary information from different sources into a composite form. It will provide synergistic information about the objects under examination and thus, help in the assessment of carotid artery disease. The proposed hybrid approach combines the strengths of feature-based and intensity-based registration approaches to attain more precise registration in challenging problems. The feature-based iterative closest point algorithm has been used to provide the initial alignment of images which was traditionally done by manual operators. Subsequently, the intensity-based approach uses rigid-body model, to describe the global motion and non-rigid free-form deformation model based on B-splines, to describe the local motion of the carotid arteries. The normalized mutual information metric assessed the similarity in both rigid and non-rigid transformation models. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the proposed hybrid technique have also been presented. The results showed that the proposed hybrid registration method achieved a target registration error (TRE) of 0.1094 mm which is significantly less by 79.9% as compared to TRE of 0.5444 mm achieved using pure geometric method and by 73.4% in comparison to TRE of 0.4121 mm achieved using the composition of rigid geometric and iconic approaches.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>


<p class="body"> Direct visualization of carotid
atherosclerotic plaques provides useful insights on the natural history of
atherosclerotic disease and aids in selecting appropriate treatments. Although
several imaging modalities are available to assess atherosclerotic vessels, the
two noninvasive techniques, mainly used are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and ultrasound (US). The challenge for imaging methods is to
enable identification of patients with high-risk lesions that are vulnerable to
thrombosis, so-called vulnerable plaques, before the occurrence of
cerebrovascular complications. Noninvasive MRI has great potential to enable
characterization of atherosclerotic plaque composition and morphology, which helps to assess plaque vulnerability.
It differentiates plaque components on the basis of biophysical and biochemical
parameters such as chemical composition and concentration, water content,
physical state, molecular motion or diffusion [1]. Multispectral carotid
MR imaging is able to characterize all major plaque components: active
inflammation, thin cap with large lipid-necrotic core, endothelial denudation
with superficial platelet aggregation, fissured plaque and stenosis by
depicting particular combinations of signal intensities of each component on
images obtained with different contrast weightings [2].</p>

<p class="body"> 
The limitations
of MRI are that it is expensive, less accessible for use as a screening tool
and lacks the temporal resolution necessary to evaluate instantaneously the
dynamic characteristics of the carotid wall for estimation of tissue strain and
biomechanical properties. Imaging of carotid dynamics is however possible with
new US imaging systems. US imaging provides a convenient and inexpensive
assessment of the carotid arteries and is currently being used in obtaining
measurements of the total plaque area, plaque volume and vessel wall volume. It is less traumatic to the patient and offers a high
temporal resolution enabling motion analysis to
measure the distensibility of the artery and provides images that have higher in-plane
resolution [3, 4].</p>

<p class="body"> 
Typically, only one of these
examinations is performed, but, potentially the dynamic characteristics
information and biomechanical characterization with US systems complement
plaque composition information and high-resolution structural imaging with
carotid MR. This motivates the use of <i>multimodality</i> approach to carotid
plaque assessment. Spatial coregistration and combined visualization (fusion)
of the images produced by MR and US modalities will allow a detailed comparison
of both modalities in depicting the carotid bifurcation anatomy and lesions. Coregistration is an important first step in the use of
complementary information obtained from fused images. It establishes spatial
alignment between images from different modalities so that the exact
point-to-point correspondence between image data sets is known. The techniques for multimodality registration fall into either <i>feature-based</i>,
which establish correspondence between a limited set of identified salient
points (landmarks) or <i>intensity-based</i>, which operate directly on image
gray values. The applications of multimodality registration are abundant and
diverse, predominantly diagnostic in nature. A coarse division would be into <i>anatomical-anatomical</i>
registration, where images showing different aspects of tissue morphology are
combined and <i>functional-anatomical</i>, where tissue metabolism and its
spatial location relative to anatomical structures are related [5, 6].</p>

<h4> 2. Literature Review </h4>

<p class="body"> Many researchers
have developed intensity-based algorithms for multimodality fusion of carotid
MR and US images. The first three-dimensional (3D) rigid registration algorithm
for multimodal carotid images was reported by Slomka et al. [7], where
they used voxel-based method to register 3D magnetic resonance angiography
(MRA) images with 3D power Doppler (PD) US and indirectly with 3D B-mode US
images. Subsequently, Chan et al. [8] assessed the accuracy of first
non-rigid algorithm for fusion of 3D US and MR carotid data using the
thin-plate-spline based deformable models. A biomechanical "twisting and
bending" model was proposed by Nanayakkara et al. [9] for voxel-based
non-rigid registration of multimodal carotid US and MR images. In order to
correctly match two sets of images from different modalities, Rosas-Romero <i>et
al.</i> [10] presented a novel approach for registration of 3D images based on
optimal free-form rigid transformation. The reference objects for registration
were the lumen of a carotid artery and the experiments were conducted to
register sequences of MRI images to histology images of the carotid artery.</p>

<p class="body"> 
Feature-based approaches for multimodality registration have been explored to a lesser
extent. The main difficulty with these approaches lies in the feature
extraction step. Recently, Chiu et al. [11] developed
the first geometric feature-based rigid registration algorithm for
characterization of carotid plaque components. The algorithm used a
surface-based iterative closest point (ICP) registration method to align
surfaces reconstructed from US and MR images. A review paper dedicated to
carotid image registration algorithms has been published by Gupta et al.
[12]. During the past few years, efforts have been made to combine the
advantages of both feature- and intensity-based approaches, resulting in a <i>hybrid
</i>approach. A number of hybrid approaches have been developed and applied in
the registration of brain and other images [13, 14 and 15]. However, the use of
hybrid approaches for multimodality carotid image registration problem has not
been reported, apart from the work by Carvalho et al. [16], who proposed
a methodology to coregister freehand US and MR carotid images using a
combination of point-based and intensity-based algorithms. Our recent
preliminary communication [17] also described a novel hybrid approach, but that
was intended for monomodality rigid registration of carotid US images. Table
1 gives an overview of multimodality carotid image registration methods
discussed so far.</p>

<p class="body"> 
This work aims
to coregister carotid MR and US images using a non-rigid methodology in a
hybrid framework which combines the geometric and iconic features of both the
images. The multimodality registration will allow the use of complementary
information from different imaging modalities to establish a diagnosis or
assist the clinician for a therapeutic gesture. To illustrate the gain in
performance, quantitative and qualitative evaluations have been
performed using a pilot set of clinical data.</p>

<h4> 3. Materials </h4>

<p class="body"> Five subjects were selected for conducting
the registration experiments. For each subject, MR and US images were obtained
around the carotid bifurcation. The prior permissions were secured from all the
patients for using their images in the experimental procedures and publishing
the results on same for the purpose of this research work.</p>


<p class="subhead">3.1. Magnetic Resonance Image
Acquisition </p>


<p class="body"> All carotid MR
scans were taken on a 1.5 Tesla system (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical
solutions, Erlangen, Germany) using custom-built matrix coils (head, neck and
spine). Patients were positioned supine on the scanner table. The MR
examinations for all patients included T1-, T2- and STIR (short inversion time inversion recovery)-weighted
images acquired in the axial plane. The various imaging parameters
TR/TE/flip-angle/slice-thickness/inter-slice-gap/in-plane-resolution/FOV were
as follows: 600ms/20ms/150º/4mm/0.4mm/1.3 × 0.9 × 4mm<sup>3</sup>/240 × 240mm (T1),
4420ms/72ms/150º/4mm/0.4mm/ 0.8 × 0.5 × 4mm<sup>3</sup>/240 × 240mm (T2) and
6180ms/41ms/150º/4mm/0.4mm/1 × 0.9 × 4mm<sup>3</sup>/240 × 240mm (STIR) with
time of inversion (TI) being 160ms.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 3.2. Ultrasound Image Acquisition </p>


<p class="body"> Carotid US
examinations were performed using the Voluson 730 Pro GE US machine having
state-of-the-art user interface and exceptional image quality. A high frequency
linear transducer SP 6-12 (Footprint: 38 x 4 mm, Bandwidth: 3-11 MHz and FOV:
37.4 mm) was used to acquire US images of the carotid artery by sweeping the
neck of patients along the transverse plane.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 3.3. Preparation of Datasets </p>

<p class="body"> All images were
rescaled to be of size 512 × 512 pixels (135.50 mm height and 135.50 mm width)
with pixel size 0.265 × 0.265 mm<sup>2</sup>. Five experiments were performed to
register a pair of US and MR images acquired from each of the five patients.
The registration experiments were accomplished on a personal computer running
Windows 7 operating system with an Intel Core I5-2450M processor 2.50 GHz and
8GB of RAM. The average time to complete the single registration was
approximately 320 seconds for the experimental images
reported in this work.</p>


<h4> 4. Proposed Hybrid Registration Methodology </h4>

<p class="body"> The proposed
hybrid algorithm divides the registration problem into two steps. In the first
step, it uses the feature-based (<i>geometric</i>) approach to build explicit models of identifiable landmarks in the US image
which are matched with their counterparts in the MR image. The second step uses
the intensity-based (<i>iconic</i>) method to iteratively optimize a given
similarity measure between the two images. Let <i>M</i>
and <i>U</i> represent the carotid MR and US images to be registered, {<i>X<sub>M</sub></i>}
represents the set of points in image <i>M</i> and {<i>X<sub>U</sub></i>}
represents the corresponding set of points in image <i>U</i>. The purpose of
proposed algorithm is to determine the registration transformation, <b><i>T</i></b>,
which relates the position (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) of features in one image or coordinate space with the position (<i>x&#8242;</i>,
<i>y&#8242;</i>) of the corresponding features in another image or coordinate space. </p>

The block
diagram in Fig. 1 gives an overview of the steps used for multimodality
registration of carotid MR and US images. The non-rigid registration technique
is required to account for differences in the patient's position and
soft-tissue deformations between different image acquisition sessions.</p>


<p class="subhead"> 4.1. Feature-Based Registration </p>

<p class="body"> The
feature-based iterative closest point algorithm [18] has been employed that
uses {<i>X<sub>M</sub></i>} as
model point set and {<i>X<sub>U</sub></i>} as data point set to perform the initial rigid registration. The
algorithm works by iteratively finding, for each point <i>x<sub>u</sub></i>, in
the data set {<i>X<sub>U</sub></i>}, the closest point in the model set {<i>X<sub>M</sub></i>}. This is the point <i>x<sub>m</sub></i> in {<i>X<sub>M</sub></i>} for which the distance <i>d</i> between <i>x<sub>u</sub></i> and <i>x<sub>m</sub></i>
is minimum</p>

<p class="body"> The set of
closest points (one for each <i>x<sub>u</sub></i>) achieved is {<i>P<sub>U</sub></i>}.
A least square rigid-body registration is then carried out between the two
point sets {<i>X<sub>U</sub></i>} and {<i>P<sub>U</sub></i>} using
the quaternion-based method [19]. The transformation
obtained from this stage is applied to the set of data points {<i>X<sub>U</sub></i>} and then, the closest points are determined
once again. The process iterates until the change in mean square error falls
below a defined threshold of 1e-05. The final transformation from this stage, <i>T<sub>G_rigid</sub></i>,
is used to create the roughly registered image <i>U<sup>T</sup></i>.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 4.2. Intensity-Based Registration </p>

<p class="body"> Intensity-based
approach takes the complete image data into account. The registration involves
calculating a transformation between two images by iteratively optimizing some
similarity measure calculated from all pixel values. The transformation in this
stage consists of a global transformation, <i>T<sub>I_rigid</sub></i> and a local transformation, <i>T<sub>I_non-rigid</sub></i>. The global rigid transformation model has been used to map any point in the source image into the corresponding point in
target image. In two dimensions, this model has three
degrees of freedom: two translations and one rotation. To describe the local deformation, a free-form deformation (FFD) model
based on B-splines [20] has been chosen because it is a
powerful tool for modeling deformable objects and has been used successfully
for registration of breast MR images [21]. </p>

<p class="body"> 
The normalized mutual information (NMI) similarity metric [22] assessed the
similarities between the MR and US images in both global and local transformation models since it is robust and appropriate for multimodality image
registration. NMI is defined using
image entropies as:</p>

Figure 2. Boxplot showing the comparison of different
registration procedures in terms of average values of target registration error
(TRE). The proposed method with B-spline control point spacing of 8 mm results
in the minimum target registration error.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body"> It is evident
from the results that the registrations which are based on pure geometric
transformations reduce TRE significantly and thus,
can be used to provide the rough initial alignment between the images.
Subsequently, the rigid iconic approach reduces the error slightly. Finally,
the B-spline based FFD drops the error appreciably. The proposed hybrid method achieved a TRE of 0.10941 mm which is significantly less by 79.9%
in comparison to pure geometric approach (TRE = 0.54436 mm) and by 73.4% as
compared to the composite of rigid geometric and iconic approaches (TRE = 0.41209
mm). Another observation made from the study is that the hybrid method performs
better as the resolution of the control point mesh of the spline-based FFD
increases. The main reason for this is the increased flexibility of the
spline-based FFD to describe local deformations of the
carotid artery as the number of control points increases. Overall, the proposed
hybrid method with control point spacing of 8 mm performs the best in terms of
TRE.</p>



<p class="subhead">5.2. Qualitative Assessment </p>


<p class="body"> For qualitative
validation of the proposed hybrid registration method, all results were
visually examined by two clinical radiologists. The quality of the results was
rated as: "correctly aligned", "satisfactorily aligned" and "poorly aligned".
Successful registration was defined as the registration for which the visual
agreement was "correctly aligned".  The results of such assessment are
presented in Table 3. Overall, 80% (4 out of 5) tests for five considered
patients were judged to be "correctly aligned" after the application of the
proposed algorithm. In the remaining 20% (1 out of 5) cases, the registration
was judged to be satisfactory by both the radiologists.</p>

<p class="body">An example of
unregistered carotid MR and US images acquired from a patient in transverse
view is shown in Fig. 3. The results obtained after
coregistration of US image with the corresponding MR image have been shown in
Fig. 4. The results are calculated using three different settings of
transformation models (i) ICP-based geometric rigid, (ii) composite of
geometric and iconic rigid and (iii) proposed hybrid. For the B-spline based
non-rigid registration technique, a control point spacing of 8 mm was used
since, this had provided the best results. The registered carotid US images are
fused with the corresponding MR image for an integrated display with MR being
shown in green channel and US in magenta channel.</p>

</figure>


<p class="body"> The results in
Fig. 4a clearly show that after the pure geometric registration, there are
significant misalignments between MR and US lumen segmentations. Subsequently,
the iconic rigid registration improves the results slightly, however, the
double edges can still be seen (Fig. 4b). Finally, after applying the proposed
hybrid method, the lumen segmentations are perfectly overlapped (Fig. 4c).
Thus, the visual assessment of results divulges that the
proposed hybrid method with control point spacing of 8 mm can eliminate
misregistration artifacts completely and hence, aid clinical
interpretation.</p>


<h4>6. Conclusions and Discussion </h4>

<p class="body"> MR imaging of
carotid atherosclerotic plaques provides excellent
soft-tissue characterization, but lacks the temporal resolution. On the other
hand, US provides information on carotid dynamics, but lacks the spatial
resolution of carotid MRI. Multimodality registration
of MR and US data is essential for accurately correlating the findings obtained by both
modalities for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment and basic sciences. It provides unique information which is often not available
from independent analysis of each modality. In this work, a hybrid approach based non-rigid
registration methodology has been developed
and evaluated for the fusion
of the carotid MR and US images. Five sets of intrasubject carotid MR and US images were
coregistered using the proposed hybrid algorithm. The ICP algorithm has been used to provide the initial
alignment of images. Subsequently, the intensity-based rigid transformation
model optimizes NMI similarity measure using Powell optimizer. Finally,
non-rigid registration is carried out using B-spline based FFD model to achieve
more precise alignment. The registered images have been fused to create a
composite image from two images. In order to evaluate the necessity of each
step and to establish the optimal configuration, different registration
approaches were compared quantitatively using TRE. The qualitative validation
was performed by clinical radiologists using visual inspection scheme. The
results showed that the proposed hybrid method successfully aligned MR and US
images, allowing multimodal analysis of atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid
artery.</p>
