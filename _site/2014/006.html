<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Enormous amount of studies have
been done on optical character recognition along the history in order to increase
the recognition accuracy for both printed and handwritten characters. The
improvement of recognition can be effected by modification of OCR stages, such
as pre-processing, segmentation, features extraction or recognition stage. Several
studies addressed different features to be extracted in purpose of increasing
OCR accuracy for Latin and Arabic scripts. In [1], a survey has been done on
many studies that used different features extraction techniques for Latin, such
as zoning, calculating moments and number of holes and points of the character.
For Arabic, in [2] more than one feature extraction method has been used. In
particular, information about pixels density and concavity has been collected
using the sliding windows, in addition to extracting skeleton directional-based
features on main zones. In [3], Hough transform was selected as features for
Arabic.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Accuracy of recognition for printed text has not been
discussed from the perspective of digital font design. Since font design
features play an essential role in impacting the recognition rate of printed
texts, our research centre has highlighted this area in two of its studies on
Latin and Arabic scripts. The goal is to guide typeface designers to produce
recognizable typefaces and publishers to select the appropriate recognizable
fonts. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In the present paper, we proposed the influential design
features that would mislead commercial OCR systems. This had been reached by
conducting two experiments. Each of which used more than one OCR systems to
evaluate 31 Latin and Arabic fonts. Then, results went into sub-stages
including font features measurement and finding characters similarity.
Therefore, correlations have been found between the misrecognized letters and
their design features.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  This paper discussed the related work in section 2. Then in
section 3, we described experiments done on Latin and Arabic printed text using
commercial OCR. Next, the results were analysed and discussed in section 4.
Finally in section 5, recommendations for some font design features were
specified for designers and publishers in order to afford recognizable fonts by
OCR systems.</p>

<h2> 2. Related Work </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Earlier, OCR devices were able
to read input from specially designed fonts. Later, with the development of OCR
technology, some standardization was set for OCR fonts. In 1968, two fonts
OCR-A and OCR-B were produced to be recognized by specific OCR devices. OCR-A
was one of the first standard typefaces for OCR, and it was produced by American
Type Founders. Although OCR-A was designed to be simple for machine to
recognize its alphabet, it is not very legible for human eyes. Thus, OCR-B was
provided by Adrian Frutiger for Monotype in which the design is recognizable by
machines and legible for humans [4]. It is designed following the European
Computer Manufacturers Association Standards (ECMA). The main principle in its designing
is that all characters must differ from each other at least in worst case by 7%
when they are superimposed over each other. In order to do so, using serif was
avoided because it increases the coverage area of the character which will
increase the similarity between characters. To differentiate similar shape
characters, such as (i, j, l), serif, horizontal bar or curved stroke may be
added [5]. Several design principles of OCR-B had been applied in designing
OCR-D font for Devanagiri script. OCR-D gave better results when it was tested
using commercial OCR compared to other fonts [6]. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Although research has been done
on optical font recognition (OFR) problems, none of them, to our knowledge, raises
that the design of fonts could affect the recognition process. Zramdini and
Ingold [7] provided a statistical approach for OFR based on global
typographical features to classify the fonts under five attributes typeface
type, weight, slope, width, and size. A similar experiment was done by Abuhaiba
[8] on Arabic based on templates to recognize the font under similar attributes
except for the width due to the connected letters and cursive nature of Arabic
script. Cooperman [9] took the estimation of font attribute into discussion in
OCR systems. That is, to detect individual attributes of fonts, he used local
characteristics, such as serif, sans serf, contrast … etc. Most of these font
methodologies relied on the extraction of local attributes and how they affect
OFR, but there is no focus on how the feature of the font itself affecting the
recognition rate.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Some studies
showed how font design features could affect the legibility of specific
characters. One of the recent researches [10] examined the legibility of isolated letters, individual
digits, and symbols of 20 onscreen typefaces. Experiment have been conducted on
ten subjects completing 188 trials in which the characters were exposed in a
single presentation for 34 milliseconds, and subjects were asked to name them
aloud. The results yielded the most confused characters: (number 0 &#8594; letter o, number 1 &#8594; letter l, e&#8594;c,÷ &#8594;t,
and $&#8594;letter s and number 5).
Then, classification tree analysis has been applied considering font design
features for the mentioned characters. Therefore, it was recorded that specific
font characteristics:  Height, Perimeter, Midline, Height, Stem dot height, and
weight of characters: 0, 1, e, l, ÷, and $ respectively are the most
influential features at some particular measurement. For example, if the
Midline feature of letter e (which is the ratio of the height from baseline to
the centre horizontal to the overall height) is less than 0.61 pixels, it considers
legible. Another study was done by Sofie Beier and Kevin Larson [11] in which they designed two experiments to investigate the
legibility of created variations of the most misrecognized letters. They
designed three fonts; each contains letters noticed to be highly misrecognized
by previous studies "e-c-a-s-n-u- i-j-l-t-f". Within the same font, each
character had more than one variant letter form. For instance, the variation of
letter "i" was made in serif level to emphasize the separation of the stem from
the dot, while the narrow characters, such as "l,t,f,j" are widen to increase
their areas. The results provide some design recommendation that would enhance
legibility. It is recommended to double storey "a" rather than one storey
because of its lower legibility.  In addition, wide version of narrow letters
and expanding letters into ascending and descending areas are advised. The
other variations did not confirm their effect on legibility. Nevertheless, the
discussed studies examined font design features from human perspective only,
and that could be different from OCR.</p>

<h2> 3. Experiments </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Two experiments have been
conducted [12],[13] to analyze the impact of typeface design characteristics
on OCR recognition rates. One of the experiments has been conducted on Latin
typefaces while the other on Arabic. </p>

<h4> 3. 1. Selection of Fonts and OCR Systems</h4> 

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  A set of 18 Latin typefaces (nine
serif: Times New Roman, Courier New, Palatino, Century School Book, Garamond,
Batang, Century, Georgia and BerkerlyBook; and the remaining nine are sans
serif ) was selected based on their widespread usage besides their special
properties. Two different sizes were considered, 8 and 10 points, resulting in
36 fonts in total. Lower case letters only were included in this study. The
recognition rate is measured using four well-known commercial OCR systems: ABBY
FineReader 6.0 pro, TypeReader 6.0 pro, TextBridge pro millennium, and Omnipage
pro 12.0. Another set of 13 Arabic typefaces have been chosen based on their
common usage in books, magazines, and newspapers. A total of 26 fonts were
tested in two sizes 10 and 12 points. To determine the recognition rates on
Arabic, two of the best commercial Arabic OCR systems were used: Readiris pro
12 Middle East and Sakhr Gold Edition 8.</p>

<h4> 3. 2. Data Set </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The quality of the input data has
great impact on the accuracy of OCR.  Generally, the history of document,
printing process, font clarity, and data acquisition method are factors that
may affect the quality of input data. The documents that have been copied or
faxed several times would become harder to read and produce much noise when
scanned. In addition, the typeset documents are clearer than typewritten and
than the ones that produced of dot-matrix printers. Regarding fonts, small,
exotic, italic, bold, sub or super scripts fonts also have an effect on OCR
input quality. The acquisition method also has an effect on the quality of
input data. With offline acquisition, when documents are scanned, the text may
be skewed or stretched.  For on-line acquisition, distortion may appear, such
as zigzags. In both cases, the resolution of the machine also would influence
the quality of text images.  Therefore, in ordinary OCR model, the input data
pass through pre-processing stage to reduce or remove all noise, distortions,
variation and details that are meaningless for OCR [14], [15]. In our
experiments, since the focus is to analyse the fonts design features, the
documents have been generated by computer to avoid the noise and distortion
that may happen during scanning process. The documents then have been converted
to binary image. No normalization has been done to keep the effect of font size
and variation of fonts themselves. For English data set, eight documents have
been created. The contents of the text included high and low frequency words,
bigram words, high frequency N-Gram words, and nonsense words documents from
elementary books, Better Type, and Devoghelaere report. For Arabic data set, six
documents have been created including a collection of low, medium and high
frequency words. Also, they included texts taken from Arabic newspapers and
Arabic font specimen books.</p>

<h4> 3. 3. Experimental Design and Procedure 

<h4><i>3.3.1 OCR Experiments</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The four English OCR systems were fed by eight texts with
2244 words and 7859 characters in total. Text samples were converted into 200 ×
200 dpi binary images. Then, a dynamic string matching algorithm (Levenshtein
distance) is used to compare OCR output with the corresponding input ground
truth in order to catch misrecognized letters. In Arabic experiments, both OCR
systems were applied to a set of six samples including 3071 words. Those
samples had been converted to images with 300 × 300 dpi resolution. Then, the
same matching algorithm was used to find the misleading letters. Figure 2
describes the experiment procedure.</p>

<h4> <i>3.3.2 Measuring Font Design Features</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  From the perspective of typeface design, font features were
measured for both scripts Latin and Arabic. Since Arabic font features are
totally different than Latin, different gauges have been used. Figure 3 shows
the main design aspects for both scripts [16]. The baseline is where all
characters are set on. Based on that, the other features are determined. For
Latin, the xHeight is the height of lower case 'x' from baseline; Ascender is
the height that extends above x-height; Descender is the portion of the
character that extends under the baseline. Arabic typeface features differ regarding
to diversity of writing scripts. Instead of xHeight, there are tooth and loop
height as in letter (&#1602;) ,
(&#1588;)  respectively. Thus,
there are two ascenders: one extends above loop height whereas the other extends
above tooth height [17], [18].  </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Some features like fixed and variable spacing, serif, and
sans serif were detected using Fontlab4.5 in addition to human observation.
Other font features were calculated using mathematical equations, and the
needed terms like xHeight, ascender and descender were determined from the
projection profile based on the method used in [7]. For all measured values,
pixel unit was used. In Latin, the proportion of <i>xHeight</i>, ascender <i>XA</i>,
and descender <i>XD</i> were computed using equations (1) and (2).</p>

<div class="eqn-number">(2)</div>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Equation (3) measures the vertical and horizontal stroke
thickness, weight <i>W<sub>i</sub></i> , in which <i>T<sub>i</sub></i>
representing the average of vertical and horizontal stem thickness of all
letters for each font considering the most frequent vertical and horizontal
black runs.</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="006%20-%20JMTA_files/image007.png" class="img">[i=vertical, horizontal]
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(3)</div>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In Arabic, The aspect ratio <i>AR</i> of a character, as in
equation (4) was calculated using the letter 'Seen' (&#1587;). The contrast <i>C</i> is the ratio between the thickness of
vertical <i>T<sub>v</sub></i> and horizontal <i>T<sub>h</sub></i> strokes as in
equation (5). This gauge is calculated using three isolated letters 'Kaaf' ((&#1603;, 'Alef'
(&#1575;) and 'Beh' (&#1576;). The weight of typeface <i>W<sub>ij</sub></i> , that expresses
its heaviness, was measured by equation (6).  Four different weight proportions
were calculated as ratio of the vertical and horizontal stroke to the loop and
tooth height. The measurements were calculated using isolated letters 'Alef' (&#1575;), 'Feh' (&#1601;) and 'Beh' (&#1576;). </p>

</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(6)</div>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Furthermore, different proportions between main design
features have been calculated. The word height <i>WH</i> was calculated by the
difference between bottom and top of the word. Since Arabic typeface has loop
and tooth, it has two ascenders <i>ascender<sub>j</sub></i>, one extended above
the loop and the other extended above the tooth and they were measured by
finding the difference between loop/tooth height <i>H<sub>j</sub></i> and top. On
the other hand, the descender in Arabic is the lower part under baseline and
its value is the difference between bottom and baseline. The value of word
height <i>WH</i> was used to calculate the proportion with two heights <i>HP<sub>j</sub></i>,
loop and tooth, as in equation (7). The proportion between the two ascenders <i>ascender<sub>j</sub></i>
and the word height <i>WH</i> were calculated as in equation (8). Moreover, the
proportion between the word height <i>WH</i> and descender has been calculated
as in (9) using letter 'Meem' (&#1605;).
The ratio among three measurements, tooth/loop height, ascender and descender,
have been calculated using equations (10) (11) (12). </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  For both scripts, similarity distances have been calculated
for each pair of letters within the same font to determine which pairs of
letters are vulnerable to be misrecognized. To estimate similarity, gradient
features, magnitude, and directions of the greatest change in intensity in a
small neighbourhood for each pixel were extracted for each character image. A
sequence of pre-processing operations had been done including image
binarization using Otsu threshold, white space removal suing bounding box
techniques, and normalization using linear interpolation algorithm. In the normalization
step, the two following equations (13) and (14) were used where (i,j) are the
dimensions (width, height) of the original letter image, and &#946; = max (I/32,
J/32) in which (I,J) are the dimensions of the cut image.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Then, for each letter image a feature vector of
size 400 was produced having 5×5 vector and 16 directional resolution for Latin
and vector of size 512 (4×4) and 32 directional resolutions for Arabic using
Roberts Operator model. Then, a threshold was applied to nullify pixels with
low gradient magnitude to highlight the important information for similarity
measurement. The Euclidean distance was used to calculate similarity for each
pair. Figure 4 illustrates the procedure of extracting character shape
similarity.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> For
each Latin font in this study, the lower case of letters from "a" to "z" is
compared with lower case letters from "a" to "z" and upper case letters from
"A" to "Z" coming up with 26 × 52 pairs.&nbsp;For Arabic,
the total number of characters is 112, which includes the four shapes for 28
letters. The similarity distance has been calculated for 112×112 pairs for each
font. </p>

<h4> 3. 4. Results </h4>
<h4> <i>3.4.1. Results of OCR Experiment</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In general, a bigger size provides a better performance in
all used OCR systems. Accuracy for English OCRs (93% - 99%) is much better than
Arabic OCRs (46% - 91%). Figure 2 illustrates the average recognition rates for
all tested English and Arabic fonts. </p>

<h4> <i>3.4.2 Results of Measuring Font Design Features</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  For both Scripts, the maximum
and minimum values were obtained for each proposed font feature. Also, the average
of all measured features was calculated. Table 1 is listing these values for
Latin and Arabic respectively. These obtained facts have been used later in the
analyses regard finding factors affect recognition process negatively.</p>

<h2> 4. Analyses and Discussion </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  After getting the recognition rates from OCR tools for all
font sets and measuring font design features, the following observation and
statistical correlation have been highlighted using Spearman test. For Latin,
it is observed that long serif design of individual letters cause
misclassification on (b,h), (u,n), (o,n), (o,u). In addition, balancing is
required among x-height, ascender, and descender. That is, if the x-height is
very short, it produced many errors of central letters especially in small
size. Garamond is an example and it showed recognition errors with: (e,c),
(o,r), (c,r), (a,s). Else, if x-height is larger than ascender and descender,
it gave unclear letters causing errors, such as (i,j), (v,y), (g,u), (q,u),
(o,g), (f,t) in Heattenschweiler and Impact fonts. Figure 7 provide explanatory
example of x-height comparing with the ascender and descender.  Moreover, the
extreme and light thickness of stroke decreased the recognition rate because a very
thick stroke makes a letter look very dark, narrow, and with little white space
inside the letter leading to errors like (e,c), (e,o), (a,e). Though, light
strokes such as in BerkerlyBook and Courier New decreased recognition rate
particularly in small size. Table 1 presents the misrecognized letters for each
Latin font.</p><br />

<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  For Arabic, there are moderate to strong positive
correlation between the loop and tooth height and accuracy of OCR recognition.
The fonts that have loop height around average = 4.88, and tooth height also
around average= 5.7 are having a high recognition rate. Other than that,
problems could accrue due to two reasons: having different tooth height in one
character, and having very long or short loop height near the maximum or
minimum values. Figure 8 shows letter "Sin" in Fresco font with different tooth
heights in the same letter causing OCR systems to recognize it as three
connected letters "Lam". Figure 9 illustrates very long loop height in Fresco
font and very short loop height in Microsoft Uighur leading to errors in the
recognition process of letter "Qaf" and "Wow". Moreover, the proportion of the
ascender to descender should not be very big. Having this proportion around
0.7-0.8 could be good enough to produce a high recognition rate. Table 2 shows
the misrecognized letters for each Arabic font.  The other measurements showed
weak correlation to the OCR accuracy.</p>

<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  From the similarity experiments, pairs of letters observed to
be frequent by misrecognized. For Latin fonts, it is found that some common
character pairs which have similar shape design with low distance value
increased recognition errors especially with sans serif fonts such as, lower
case of letter 'l' and upper case of letter 'i' of fonts Arial,
FrutigerLinotype, Heattenschweiler, Helvetica, Impact, and Microsoft Sans
Serif. For Arabic fonts, there was misrecognition with low distance between
four different forms of a letter (initial, middle, final and isolated) in
general. Also, the letters that have the same basic letter form and differ only
in the number of dots, such as "sin" and "shin" are frequently misrecognized.</p>

<h2> 5. Conclusion </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  This paper has addressed the idea of font features that
negatively affect OCR. The main aim is to prove that typeface design
characteristics may have an influence on the recognition process. Two studies
have been conducted on Latin and Arabic scripts on a total of 31 fonts in two
sizes. Six commercial OCR systems have been used in these experiments providing
better accuracy for larger size in general. Then, font design characteristics
were measured. Results of OCR and font design measurement were analyzed and
observed. So, it is found that some font design features are associated with
fonts that have high recognition while others did not give any correlations. Further
studies can analyze the effective font design features as a combination instead
of having them individually, and find the correlations between them in order to
produce clear recognizable font characteristics. The results have shown that
different fonts produce different OCR recognition rates. This study can be used
as a guide to choose more legible digital fonts for electronic display digital
publishing and human application.</p>
