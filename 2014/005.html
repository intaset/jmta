<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">  Human Computer
Interaction (HCI) based on audiovisual inputs can benefit to users greatly. More
importantly, the effects may be more prominent for users with disabilities, since
traditional computer input methods can be proven to be ineffective. Tactile
devices, such as the keyboard and mouse, are difficult to use in many
circumstances and are generally not considered to be a natural form of interaction.
Various approaches have been proposed and a number of implementations exist,
that attempt to utilize other modalities for the task of controlling a computer.
Since speech is one of the most natural means for human communication, its use
is widespread in the literature. Kader et al. [1] created a system based on the
MS API and Voice-XML for conducting basic actions of the operating system. This
work was extended by Kadam et al. [2] by combining Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in order to recognize spoken vocal commands. Sporka
et al. [3] used speech in order to evaluate the effectiveness of spoken and
other vocal information for controlling videogames. Various proposed system
implementations also exist using either software or hardware [4, 5]. Furthermore,
numerous applications are used in everyday life for dictation and interaction
with devices such as mobile phones and cars [6]. Finally, other sources of
information have been investigated for the task of controlling a computer,
primarily employing visual information of the user's gaze, either with
specialized hardware or cameras [7, 8, 9].</p>

<p class="body">  Existing solutions are
built having in mind a specific OS or application and are bound to macros or
static templates to perform more complicated actions. Additionally, they are
generally limited due to the fact that most modern operating systems are
designed primarily for interaction with a keyboard and mouse. Systems based on
eye gaze may be able to provide a "mouse-like" interaction, but can be quite
inefficient at actions involving clicking, scrolling, and fine positioning. Finally,
speech based systems depend heavily on the accuracy and robustness of the
underlining automatic speech recognition engine. </p>

<p class="body">  According to [14] more
sophisticated interaction can be achieved by using natural input and output.
This enables users to perform more quickly, more complex tasks, more
accurately. In this paper, we present the framework of an audiovisual system for
computer control which addresses the shortcomings of available systems by
employing audiovisual dialog-based interaction. Our architecture collects not
only audio signals but also visual articulation information from the speaker's
face, in order to increase the word recognition accuracy and robustness. At the
same time, rather than requiring cumbersome specialized hardware, it utilizes
the low cost microphone and camera that most laptops are equipped with. Additionally,
a dialog system (DS) is used to generate interaction events, such as clicking, scrolling,
opening or closing programs, etc., based on verbal cues issued by the user,
utilizing a grammar that is specific to the application used. It is the authors'
belief that this architecture is able to provide natural speech-based
interaction with existing operating systems without requiring a complete
redesign of the GUI.</p>

<h4> 2. Methodology </h4>

<p class="body">  Our system
architecture is comprised of two main components, action generation, which
interprets the intentions of the user into actions and the audiovisual speech
recognition (AVSR) component, which acts as a front-end to the former.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 2.1 Audiovisual Speech Recognition </p>

<p class="body">  The AVSR module that
is integrated to the system is used for recognition of vocal commands by the
user. This module utilizes the computer's built-in microphone and camera, in
order to capture the audio signal of the speaker's voice as well as the mouth
region of speaker's face (Figures 1a, b). This approach ensures higher
reliability for the system, since each stream captures correlated information
from a different source, which can complement each other. </p>

<p class="body">  The features extracted
from the audio stream are the well-known Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) and the features extracted from the video stream are the 2-D Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients from the region of interest (ROI) of the
speaker (mouth). The size of the ROI is 64x64 pixels and the features extracted
for each frame are 45, corresponding to the highest energy coefficients.  An example
of the visual feature extraction is shown in Figure 1c.</p>

<p class="body">  The statistical
modelling is carried out by means of HMMs and the implementation is based on
HTK [10]. The feature vectors fed to HTK are modified in order to contain
features from both streams, through concatenation. The Baum-Welch algorithm is
used for training the models and the Viterbi algorithm is used for recognition.
The recognized commands are finally used by the system in order to execute a
specific action of the OS or the application used.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 2.2 Action Generation </p>

<p class="body">  In order to understand
the intentions of the user we developed a DS which is able to infer the user's
intentions by taking into account vocal commands of the AVSR module, contextual
information (the current OS "state") and the history of the interaction. Figure
2 depicts our DS's architecture, which is composed of the AVSR component [11], an
NLU component from Olympus [12] and a dialog manager (DM). For the NLU we have
created a grammar, in order to retrieve the meaning of the user's utterance
(vocal command) which covers basic interaction with an OS. For specific
applications, such as image manipulation, emails, writing text etc., we have
created other grammars that work in conjunction with the more general one. The
DM is responsible for integrating information from the NLU and OS and history,
to identify regions of interest and regions where the user may interact with
the system (such as an "OK" button). The system actions we defined for our DS
essentially correspond to commands for the operating system. Available actions
include click (left / right), move mouse, tab, escape, help, forward, backward
and others. For specific applications we may have additional actions as well.
The DS is called when the user provides a vocal cue, such as "click here" or
"search for available apartments in the area".</p>

<figcaption>
Figure 2. System
overview. Our system can be easily configured to interact with various
operating systems. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">  We opted to use a DS,
as it is much easier to manage and much more scalable than using a set of
complicated vocal commands, that would be specific to each application. To
model the dialog for this application, we followed the Information Seeking <span
style='color:black'>[13] paradigm. The basic idea is that the system
prompts the user (or waits) for some pieces of information, necessary to
perform a specific task. When the system has enough information, it is able to
perform the task. For example, a flight booking dialog system would prompt the
user for dates, origin and destination, before performing the booking. In our
case, the system does not reply to the user, but rather performs a task, such
as to open an internet browser and use a search engine, or magnify a part of
the screen. The DS also takes contextual information into account, so when the
user wants to search for a keyword and is currently reading a document, the
system will search within that document; when a list of files is in the
foreground of the desktop, the system will look for a file whose name matches
the keyword; and when the user is browsing the web, the system will search for
the keyword using a search engine.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.3 NLU Grammars</p>

<p class="body">  To account for the
various meanings the user's utterance may have, depending on the application,
and to promote simplicity by allowing phrases to map to several meanings, we
have developed several grammars, one for each interaction scenario. Depending
on the current focus of the operating system (the application being used), as
well as contextual information (applications running in the background, etc.),
we select the appropriate grammar. Currently, we have grammars for generic
interaction, i.e. when no program is selected or when the user is browsing
through the operating system's settings and folders/files. Another grammar is
designed for internet browsing and another for text processors. In the future
we plan to develop more advanced grammars, targeted for professional programs,
such as architectural design, video and photograph editing, etc. Table 1 shows part
of the internet browsing grammar. </p>

<h4>3. Results </h4>

<p class="body">  We report preliminary results for the
word recognition accuracy of the user's intended action. We conducted
experiments on the accuracy achieved in comparison to a traditional audio-only
speech based system in realistic scenarios under the presence of audio noise
and various visual degradations. In addition we tested its performance under
the influence of audio noise and partial absence of visual information caused
by a black block (Figure 3a), affecting lip movements and causing slurred
speech. Our experimental paradigm focuses on the recognition and successful
execution of 11 tasks by our system. These 11 tasks are shown in Table 1 and
focus on basic navigation functionality using an open-source web browser.
Furthermore, they constitute a subset of the potential commands and actions
that could be used and recognized by the system, but they were considered
adequate for the "proof of concept" experiments that were conducted.</p>

<p class="body">  Our results are presented in figures
3b and c respectively, and show high accuracy for ideal conditions (&gt;95%)
and a significant gain in robustness in comparison to the baseline audio-only system
in a variety of noise levels, even when both the audio and visual information
are affected. </p>

<h4>4. Conclusions </h4>

<p class="body">  Our system architecture
combines audiovisual speech recognition and a dialog manager in order to
effectively derive the user's intentions. Such a framework simplifies HCI and
additionally enables the disabled to be able to interact with computers thus
enhancing their quality of life and increasing their productivity.  Our
experimental results are promising, attaining high recognition accuracy for the
user's intentions. This claim was verified even under adverse audio and visual
conditions, simulating a variety of real life scenarios.</p>
